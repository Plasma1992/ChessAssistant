# ChessAssistant

## Context  

The Chess Assistant will help you know if there's a killer move you can make in your turn, with the current status of the board. Although this function might be too slow or not practical to use during a real match, it was fun to code it and achieve the expected result.  
In order to use the Assistant, you have to set the board first: you will give the name and location of the white piece you are interested in (e.g. pawn a2). Then, you can set as many black pieces in the board as you want (hey! no more than 16, don't go crazy). Whenever you are done setting the board, you must write the word "Done".  
With this, the program will find your killer move, if any, and tell you which black pieces can be eaten by the white piece you placed.
